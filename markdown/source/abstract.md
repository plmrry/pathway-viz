\parttitle{Background} Understanding complicated networks of bio-molecular entities and interactions is essential to solving contemporary problems in modern biology, especially in computational domains such as systems biology.
In these domains, biological data takes the form of metabolic networks or *pathways*, which are used to represent chains of interactions that occur within the context of a given biological process.
Visual representations of pathway data can help researchers understand, interact with, and reason about these complex pathways in a variety of ways.
At the same time, the complex nature of these datasets offers unique challenges for visualization due to their complexity and heterogeneity.

\parttitle{Results} Here, we present a taxonomy of visual analysis tasks that are relevant to researchers who work with biological pathway data.
These tasks were generated with input and feedback from several domain experts in biology.

\parttitle{Conclusions} Included in this taxonomy are several complex tasks that do not appear in other existing visual task taxonomies.
We also examine existing visualization techniques that support each task, and we discuss gaps in the visualization literature that are revealed by our taxonomy.
We conclude by suggesting several avenues of future research based on our taxonomy and motivated by the comments received by domain experts.
